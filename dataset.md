physiological signals requires  reliable but energy-efficient algorithms, suitable datasets are essential for their development, evaluation, and benchmark


raw signal/data

In case of PPG this means that the recordings contain the directly captured values from the analog-todigital converter (ADC) which receives the amplified analog signal from the photodetector, usually via a transimpedance amplifier
